>
> Implement and train a **convolution neural network** from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). You should write your own code for convolutions (e.g., do not use SciPy's convolution function). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It should achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set. For full credit, submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which states the Test Accuracy and briefly describes the implementation. Due September 14 at 5:00 PM.



## Test accuracy

**`98.2%`**. See the following training and testing output:
