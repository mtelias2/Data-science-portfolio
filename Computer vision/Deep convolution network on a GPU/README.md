> HW3: 
>
> Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (C) data augmentation. For 10% extra credit, compare dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation. For full credit, the model should achieve 80-90% Test Accuracy. Submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which reports the results and briefly describes the model architecture. Due September 28 at 5:00 PM.

## Test accuracy

**`87.13%`**.
